# What is OfficeOnlineAPI?
OfficeOnlineAPI is a software based on Libre office online useful for editing .docx and .odt files in the browser. OfficeOnlineAPI website (https://www.officeonlineapi.com) contains the docs to integrate this functionality. This software gives IT companies and developers the possibility to:  
1) Open a file that resides on their server
2) Edit it in the browser
3) Store it back on the server

# OfficeOnlineAPI story
OfficeOnlineAPI is a RESTful API born for one reason. Give developers and IT companies an affordable and easy solution for editing in the browser .docx and .odt files that reside on their servers.

Our story started when several customers wanted the possiblity to edit documents in the browser from our web applications.
After some weeks of researching solutions to this problem, we, as a company, decided to use in our systems Libre office online. The process of installation failed because of the lack of good documentation. Also Libre Office online needs lots of hardware resources and therefore an infrastructure for scalability.

Then we integrated commercial solutions, but for our company they weren't cost effective.

The last alternative was to try again with libre office online and to understand its source code and how to configure it.

The process of configuration and improvement of the software took more than 8 months and was focused on improving the GUI and the performance of the software as well as create a scalable hardware infrastructure.

That's where we thought that our solution could be useful and affordable also for other companies/developers across the world.
We also thought that:

1) Implementing the same solution for an IT company would need cloud solutions that, if we consider idle times, are less cost effective than our service.

2) A company/developer that would like to solve this problem needs to create the infrastructure, improve the libre office online software, create a generalized mechanism to deal with file management and interaction with libre office.

Being this project at the early stages of its life, we would love to hear from developers and companies their thoughts.

The code of this repository is the modified open source software.
